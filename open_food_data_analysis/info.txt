what you can say about this project:-
“I analyzed a global food product dataset with 300K+ items.
I cleaned and focused on nutrition, brand, and geography data.
Then, I found the most popular brands, sugar-heavy foods, and top countries.
I also identified the healthiest and unhealthiest items using NutriScore.”
